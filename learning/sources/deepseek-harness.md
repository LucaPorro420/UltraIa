# DeepSeek Harness

English | [ä¸­æ–‡](README.zh.md)

DeepSeek Harness (`dsh`) is an open-source agent harness developed by [DeepSeek AI](https://deepseek.com).

It uses an architecture where **everything is a plugin**, and is powered by [Cordis](https://github.com/cordiverse/cordis), whose design is described in [_A Programming Paradigm for Spatiotemporal Composability_](https://github.com/cordiverse/paper).

## Developer preview

DeepSeek Harness is currently in _developer preview_ and is iterating rapidly. **THERE WILL BE COMPATIBILITY-BREAKING CHANGES.**

## Run

### Run from `npm`

Install `Node.js`, then run:

```sh
npx @deepseek-ai/dsh web
```

The command starts the Web UI, served at `http://127.0.0.1:3080` by default. See [Web UI guide](docs/user/guide/index.md).

# DeepSeek Harness Architecture

English | [ä¸­æ–‡](architecture.zh.md)

Read this before changing anything under `packages/`. It assumes you know Cordis; if you do not, start with the [primer](cordis-primer.md) or the [tutorial](cordis-tutorial/index.md).

We recommend using an agent to explore the codebase and understand its architecture.

## Cordis

[Cordis](cordis-primer.md) is the framework under dsh: plugins contribute services, typed events, and reversible effects to a shared context. Every part of the product is a plugin, including the model adapter, the tool registry, the session log, and the agent loop itself, so every part is replaceable from configuration.

There is no privileged core to patch: you extend dsh by mounting a plugin beside the others, and registrations are effects that unwind when their plugin unloads.

## Profiles and bundles

A running `dsh` is a plugin tree composed at boot from ordered layers.

A **profile** is a named composition stored in the Harness home. It lists the bundles it stacks, holds any out-of-tree plugins it installs, and keeps the user's own `cordis.patch.yml`. `web` and `headless` ship as templates.

A **bundle** is a distribution format for Cordis config rows and the code they mount, so whatever it inserts stays patchable by the layers above it.

Each declares itself in its own `package.json` under a `dsh` field: `dsh.profile` lists a profile's bundles, and `dsh.bundle` points at a bundle's patch file.

[`dsh-base`](../packages/bundle/base/README.md) is the first layer of every profile: model adapters, tools, persistence, sandbox and approval policy, settings, credentials, telemetry. [`dsh-web-app`](../packages/bundle/web-app/README.md) adds the browser application; [`dsh-headless`](../packages/bundle/headless/README.md) adds a one-shot runner with no server at all.

Layers apply to an empty entry list in this order: each bundle in the profile's listed order, then the profile's `cordis.patch.yml`, then the home-level one, then any `--patch` overlay. A patch targets a row by id and replaces its whole config, or inserts new rows.

To see the tree your machine actually boots:

```sh
dsh --profile web --dump-config
```

Any row it prints can be replaced by a patch of your own.

Composition mechanics are in [app-boot](../packages/boot/app-boot/README.md#profiles); config fields are in the generated [config catalog](config-catalog.md).

## Core packages

Here are some core packages that contribute to the Cordis tree.

| Package | Owns | `ctx` key |
|---|---|---|
| [`core/session`](subsystems/session.md) | The append-only `SessionEvent` log and in-memory store | `ctx.sessions` |
| [`core/system-prompt`](subsystems/system-prompt.md) | Prompt-section and tool-schema assembly | `ctx.systemPrompt` |
| [`core/tools`](subsystems/tools.md) | The scoped tool registry and guarded execution pipeline | `ctx.tools` |
| [`core/agent`](subsystems/core.md) | The `Agent` interface, live registry, and `agent/*` events | `ctx.agents` |
| [`core/agent-loop`](subsystems/core.md) | The default driver implementing that interface | `ctx.agentLoop` |
| [`core/scope`](subsystems/scope.md) | The per-agent scoped-registration primitive | library, no key |
| [`llm/llm`](subsystems/llm-streaming.md) | Message and stream vocabulary plus the adapter seam | `ctx.llm` |

## Events

Events are the extension points, and picking the right domain is the first decision in most changes.

- **Session events** are durable facts appended to the log and broadcast through `session/event`. Use one when the fact must survive a reload.
- **Agent events** (`agent/*`) carry a live `Agent`: inbox, step, status, request, validation, continuation. Use one to observe or intercept work in flight.
- **Capability events** attach policy and adapters to a seam (`fs/*`, `tools/*`, `telemetry/*`) without importing the loop.

The [event map](event-producer-consumer.md) lists every event's producers and consumers.

## Turn flow

A **step** is one model request plus the tools it calls. A **turn** is zero or more steps: it opens before its first input is claimed and closes once nothing is owed.

```text
turn/start
  claim next-step input plus one queued message
  assemble prompt sections + tool schemas
  -> agent/pre-step                   reject | enter(messages)
     reject, or a first enter rewritten empty -> close the turn with no step
     step/start
     append entered messages as user/message
     derive model history from the log
     agent/request -> llm/stream -> assistant/chunk* -> assistant/message
     tool/call* -> tools/pre-execute -> tools/execute -> tools/post-execute -> tool/result*
     step/end
     tools owe another request, or next-step input arrived -> claim -> next step
  -> agent/turn-stopping
turn/end
```

`turn/*`, `step/*`, `user/message`, `assistant/*`, and `tool/*` are durable session events; the rest are live extension points across three domains. `agent/pre-step`, `agent/request`, `llm/stream`, and the three `tools/*` events are waterfalls, whose listeners must call `next()` to delegate; `agent/turn-stopping` is serial and has no `next()`.

Input reaches the driver through one inbox. Some messages wake it immediately; injected context waits in the inbox until another message does.

`agent/pre-step` decides what the model sees. Listeners may rewrite the claimed messages or reject them outright; a rejected or empty first claim still closes a durable turn that spent no step, so the log records the attempt. Each step reads the prompt sections and tool schemas that plugins registered.

Details: the [sequence diagram](agent-lifecycle.md), the [tool pipeline](tool-execution-pipeline.md), and [cancellation and error recovery](subsystems/core.md#the-agent-handle).

## Session log

The session log is the source of the context the model sees. `deriveMessages()` projects model history from it, and raw `assistant/chunk` events preserve replay and UI fidelity. Fork, resume, transcripts, telemetry, and persistence all derive from this stream.

**Model-visible means logged.** Anything that reaches a model request must be reconstructable from the log, and a runtime invariant asserts it. This is why a new model-visible input requires a new session event: extend `SessionEventMap` and render from the log.

## Capability seams

A **seam** is a swappable capability with three roles: a **Service Definition** declaring the interface, a **Service Provider** implementing it, and a **Consumer** using it, commonly a model-facing tool. A package may combine roles, but one role alone is not a seam; adding a capability means designing all three ([capability graph](capability-seams.md)).

Seams are why one provider swap changes the whole product. Filesystem and subprocess providers share one execution world, so pointing them at a remote sandbox moves Bash, PTY, and LSP with them, with no provider forks. [Subagent providers](subsystems/subagent.md) vary just as widely behind one interface, from a fresh child agent to a delegated turn in another product.

## Where new behavior goes

New behavior attaches to a documented extension point. Changing the loop itself updates this map.

| Goal | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Add a model provider | register its adapter on `ctx.llm` |
| Add a model-facing capability | register on `ctx.tools`; its schema joins prompt assembly |
| Give one session a different capability set | compose an agent preset; a service row there needs an `isolate` realm |
| Add shell execution | register a `ctx.shell` backend; the local one spawns through `ctx.subprocess` |
| Add persistent terminal execution | register a `ctx.terminals` backend plus `dsh-tool-terminal` |
| Add a human command | register on `ctx.commands`; it dispatches without a model turn |
| Add background work | register on `ctx.jobs`; `job_*` tools collect or stop it |
| Add filesystem access or policy | register a `ctx.fs` provider or listen to `fs/*` events |
| Confine spawned processes | use a `ctx.sandbox` backend; consumers wrap argv before spawning |
| Intercept a request, tool, or turn | use its `agent/*` or `tools/*` event; `agent/turn-stopping` stops a turn |
| Add model-facing context | call `agent.inject()`; it lands in the next admitted request |
| Add UI or editor integration | drive `ctx.agents` and render from `session/event` |
| Add a Web Client Chat node | register a `ConversationNodeDefinition` + keyed renderer |
| Add durable session state | extend `SessionEventMap`; render and replay from the log |
| Generate session titles | register the sole `ctx.sessionTitle` provider |
| Manage a same-session objective | use `ctx.goals`; continue through `agent/*` |
| Fork a live session | `ctx.sessions.fork(source, boundary?, childSessionId?)` |
| Scope a registration to one agent | use that agent's `agent.ctx` |

The [extension cookbook](cookbook/extension-cookbook.md) maps features to capabilities and indexes the step-by-step guides for [packages](cookbook/adding-a-package.md), [tools](cookbook/adding-a-tool.md), [LLM adapters](cookbook/adding-an-llm-adapter.md), [Chat nodes](cookbook/adding-a-conversation-node.md), and [settings cards](cookbook/adding-a-settings-card.md).

# AGENTS.md

# AGENTS.md

DeepSeek Harness is a plugin-based agent harness on vendored Cordis: **everything is a plugin**. Read [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) before changing `packages/`; follow [docs/AGENTS.md](docs/AGENTS.md) for documentation.

## Pre-release stance: foundation over blast radius

**Remove this section at the first tagged release.** With no external consumers, prefer the correct foundation over compatibility shims: rename or repackage freely and update every reference together. Backends reject old on-disk formats. SQLite uses monotonic `SCHEMA_VERSION`; `dsh-session` keeps `SESSION_FORMAT_VERSION` at `0` with no compatibility promise.

```

### Host sandbox failures

When required `gh`, `pnpm`, build, test, or generator commands fail because the agent sandbox blocks credentials, network, IPC, file watching, or nested `sandbox-exec`, retry unchanged with the narrowest host escalation before diagnosing authentication or project failure. Require sandbox evidence; never bypass genuine test failures or the product sandbox under test.

### Run relevant checks locally

Run checks before pushes via [dsh-pre-push-checks](.agents/skills/dsh-pre-push-checks/SKILL.md); report only commands run. After `gh stack sync`, validate immediately; do not merge before checks pass.

- Match evidence to the surface: focused tests for behavior, snapshots for model or user output, `doc-sync` for docs, build/hygiene and built smokes for published paths, and real-API e2e for provider behavior.
- Never default to the full suite or repeat a passing check for commit or push. CI owns exhaustive coverage and the platform matrix; rehearse all locally only by explicit request, for CI diagnosis, or for an irreducibly repository-wide change.
- `test:coverage`, not `test`, is the CI coverage gate ([why](docs/testing.md)).

## Secrets / .env

Real-API tests and demos read `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, optional `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL`, and root `.env`. cordis.yml allows `!!js` (never `!js`) under plugin `config` and entry `disabled`; other metadata stays literal, so conditional composition also uses overlays ([primer](docs/cordis-primer.md#loader-configuration)). Never commit credentials. CI e2e skips without a key; [testing.md](docs/testing.md) owns key policy.

## Conventions

- Every npm package is `@deepseek-ai/dsh-<name>`; vendored packages are rescoped ([mapping](docs/rescope.md)) and `private: true`. `@deepseek-ai/cordis` is a peerDependency (+ dev) of every harness package.
- ESM everywhere (`"type": "module"`). Use package names across packages and `.ts` in local relative imports. Config subprocesses run built `lib/` under plain Node; source regressions use their declared launcher ([testing policy](docs/testing.md#test-subprocess-launch-modes)). The `dsh` CLI source launch runs through tsx's ESM-only hook (`node --import tsx/esm`); modules it reaches must stay ESM (no CJS-only exports) â€” Node's native TypeScript modes are unavailable across the engines range ([source-launch contract](.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-07-29-dsh-source-launch-tsx-esm.md)). Raw/Web `cordis.yml` bare plugins must appear in their resolver manifest's `dependencies`; `verify-cordis-config` enforces it.
- **Registrations are effects**: every contribution goes through `ctx.effect()` / `ctx.on()`; a registry's `register()` returns the disposer.
- **Runtime invariants assert owned relationships.** Check authoritative event streams or mutable data, not service or method presence, plugin metadata or effects, or fixed pure examples. Without a plausible relationship, an explained empty companion is correct ([package invariant rules](packages/AGENTS.md)).
- **Typed events use declaration merging** and merge-extensible maps. Event JSDoc needs `@mode` and payload `@param`; scoped keys absent from payloads need `@dshScopeScan unsupported`. Public service methods document parameters and non-void returns. A `SessionEventMap` member is required-on-read by default â€” builds that do not know its type refuse the log unless the event carries the envelope's `ignorable: true`; only structural format changes bump `SESSION_FORMAT_VERSION` ([mechanism](.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-08-10-session-log-version-mechanism.md)).
- **Switch on discriminant tags.** Closed unions end in `assertNever`; merge-extensible unions fall through a documented default.
- **Waterfall listeners MUST call `next()`** to delegate; returning without it short-circuits the chain ([semantics](docs/cordis-primer.md#cordis-waterfall-semantics)).
- **Model-visible âŸº logged**: anything that reaches a model request must be reconstructable from the session log; a new model-visible input requires a session event.
- **Plugins, not loop changes**: new behavior goes on documented extension points; changing `agent-loop` requires updating docs/architecture.md.
- **A capability seam comprises Service Definition / Service Provider / Consumer roles.** It is complete, never one role; split only when roles evolve independently ([glossary](docs/glossary.md#capability-seam)).
- **Prefer maintained dependencies over hand-rolling** when they genuinely delete owned code and tests ([policy](.agents/notes/implemented/process/2026-07-26-dependencies-over-hand-rolling.md)).
- **Explicit > implicit at package boundaries**: defaulting is an explicit `resolve(request): Spec` step in the owning implementation, never a hidden `?? default` inside `run()` (the `dsh-shell` request/spec split is the template).
- **No hardcoded tunables in plugins**: deployment-varying choices are validated `Config` fields changeable from cordis.yml; a `DEFAULT_*` constant or test hook is not configurability. Protocol constants, external specs, and security invariants stay fixed.
- **Misconfiguration fails loud** at load when self-contained, otherwise at the earliest resolvable point; never silently skip a missing referent.
- **Opaque cross-boundary ids are branded** (`Branded<B>` from `dsh-brand`), never bare `string`.
- **Trust TypeScript at typed same-process boundaries.** Do not add runtime validation, fallback behavior, or hostile-input tests solely for values the static interface requires; validate at parser/config, queued, model/tool JSON, durable/file, worker, process, and wire boundaries.
- **Source plane vs artifact plane, never mixed.** Static gates and tests resolve workspace imports through tsconfig `paths` to `src` and pass on a clean tree; gates consuming built `lib/` declare that dependency ([layout](docs/development.md#typescript-project-layout)).
- **Keep compiler faces explicit.** Each package uses one aggregate except `api/remotes`; repo-wide programs seed a face config, never the root solution ([layout](docs/development.md#typescript-project-layout)).
- **An empty `catch` names what it swallows** and why nothing else can reach it; keep the `try` to one statement.
- Do not comment on facts obvious from code.
- **Prefer symmetry for parallel values**; unexplained asymmetry usually signals a missed extraction.
- **Tests describe behavior, not correctness.** Change obsolete behavior with its tests; explain why in the PR.
- **Non-trivial changes MUST include an Agent Note in the same PR;** only mechanical/local edits are exempt ([scope](.agents/notes/README.md#when-to-write-one)). Archived notes are frozen: never edit or treat them as current authority ([archive policy](.agents/notes/README.md#archiving-and-deletion)).
- **Testing policy** â€” [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md). Every non-trivial model- or product-user-visible behavior change adds or updates a keyless snapshot through a real runnable example in the same PR; package tests, e2e-only assertions, and mock-only fixtures do not substitute for the assembled application transcript. Fixtures must replay on macOS/Linux; fix fixtures, not normalizers.
- **A tool's UI render intent is part of its design**, decided up front (`generic`/`terminal`/`diff`, `locations`); presentation methods are pure functions of `args` ([cookbook](docs/cookbook/adding-a-tool.md)).
- **Plan unit, e2e, and snapshot coverage** for capability seams, lifecycle paths, and transcript output; include missing snapshot-harness support in the same change.
- **Both SDKs project the loop.** Agent-loop, session-lifecycle, and `SessionEventMap` changes update the TypeScript and Python SDK expected outputs in the same PR; `pnpm run test` covers neither ([surfaces](docs/testing.md#when-a-snapshot-test-is-required)).
- **Choose PR history deliberately.** Split independent changes; fix the introducing PR before propagation. Standalone PRs and official stacks may merge-forward or rebase after review. Rewrites use `--force-with-lease`, abort on remote movement, never raw `--force`; an in-progress merge-forward preserves its checkpoint before taking a newer base ([rationale](.agents/notes/implemented/process/2026-08-02-native-github-stacks-and-optional-rebases.md)).
- **Labels:** one PR `kind/*`, all material `area/*`, and native Issue Type ([taxonomy](.agents/notes/implemented/process/2026-08-08-unified-github-label-taxonomy.md)).
- TODO markers: `FIXME`/`TODO`/`XXX` by urgency ([semantics](docs/development.md)).
- Files end with exactly one trailing newline; `git diff --cached --check` (pre-commit) gates it.

## Defensive patterns

Read [docs/defensive-patterns.md](docs/defensive-patterns.md) before lifecycle, concurrency, subprocess, or teardown work.

## Type safety and documentation

Everything compiles under `strict: true` with `noImplicitAny`; every remaining `any` explains why narrowing is infeasible. Every module and export has concise JSDoc for its non-obvious contract; function-like exports include `@param`/`@returns`, as enforced by `verify-export-jsdoc`. Heritage-declared members, plugin-protocol slots, and constructors keep their docs at the declaring Service Definition, protocol, or class.

Comments and docs state complete contracts and context, not reasoning transcripts. Use direct, concrete terms. Do not use metaphors. Before writing `contract`, `boundary`, or `shape`, ask whether a more exact term names the subject: write `response fields`, `JSON validation`, or `ESM exports` instead of `response shape`, `validation boundary`, or `module shape`. Keep `contract` for preconditions, postconditions, invariants, compatibility promises, and other obligations that callers, callees, implementers, providers, producers, or consumers rely on. Keep a literal process, wire, security, transaction, or lifecycle boundary. Do not narrate control flow or tests, preserve review history, or restate code. Keep behavior, failure, timing, ownership, and safe-use facts; link the rationale. Use [dsh-prose-standard](.agents/skills/dsh-prose-standard/SKILL.md) for decisions. Wire mechanically checkable invariants into an executed top-level gate and prove each changed acceptance path rejects an invalid case. Use narrow, justified exceptions instead of disabling a rule globally.

Docs accompany every code change: update affected README and JSDoc contracts together. Routine bilingual work follows [docs/AGENTS.md](docs/AGENTS.md); only explicit user invocation may run `dsh-translate-docs`. Current-state prose, one physical line per paragraph, one home per fact, and word budgets live there.

## Editing these instructions

`CLAUDE.md` symlinks `AGENTS.md` at root, `packages/`, and `examples/`; edit the real file. Keep each rule self-contained while linking high-level docs. Condense when clarity survives; raise a `verify-doc-budgets` ceiling when the required content genuinely needs more space.

## Vendoring policy

`vendor/` packages are pinned source copies (manifest with upstream SHAs in [vendor/README.md](vendor/README.md)). Update via the sync procedure there; re-apply or retire the logged local modifications; rerun `pnpm run test && pnpm run build`.
